# My JavaScript Solutions for Exercism 

These are the solutions I wrote for the problems in the JavaScript track over at [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/).

Exercism provides an opportunity to practice your problem solving skills in a variety of [programming languages](http://exercism.io/languages), as well as a way of sharing your solutions with others and receiving feedback.

Using these exercises as part of my studying routine has been a nice change of pace and a good way to more deeply ingrain some concepts and learn some neat tricks along the way.

Each folder holds a README.md which describes the problem, a file with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) tests and a last file which holds my solution.
